# Diabetes Classification - 3 Algorithm Comparison
# Medical Context
Predicting diabetes onset using clinical measurements with three different ML Algorithms.
# Algorithms Implemented
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
- Random Forest
# Key Skills Demonstrated
- implementing multiple ML Algorithms
- Comparative model analysis
- Medical Data preprocessing
- implementing cross validation to model improvement
- performance evaluation(accuracy , precision , recall)
# Result
- Accuracy Gaussian Naive Bayes(84%)> Accuracy Random Forrest(83%)>Accuracy Knn(78%)
- All three models predicted that new patient is not diabetic
- Unianimous decision increases reability
